    <h2>About My Website</h2>
    <p>
        My website is going to be called HaveAGoodTrip.co. This is a business concept that my two friends (Max and Tata)
        and I have been discussing about for the last year. Now, with the opportunity to create my own website in Web
        Technologies, this concept might finally come into fruition. Our website will consist of various aspects
        relating to fashion and lifestyle where we both sell and research a curated list of products, brands and
        companies that we all represent, resonate with and express interest in. Since it's a lifestyle brand, we also
        want to display the facets of our lives that we really enjoy such as skateboarding, travel & photography, art,
        and music.
    </p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of my website is to promote the culture of fashion to those who express similar interests, while
        also showcasing the different hobbies and passions that my friends and I have in common. The main purpose of
        creating this website is so that we can envision what the interface would be like if we were to launch our
        brand, plus it will provide us with insights as to how we should market products and provide the best user
        experience for our potential customers.
    </p>
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
        HaveAGoodTrip.co aims to target 18-25 year old individuals who are interested in shifting their lifestyle via
        fashion. Being people who aspire to achieve more in our daily lives, We want to provide inspirations and share
        resources to motivate those who struggle to execute their ideas in life. By targeting people from the ages of
        18-25 we hope to generate a trend and precedent of what collaborative work can take us. Through our marketing
        strategies, we urge to form a community around like-minded people who seek to change their lifestyles for the
        better.
    </p>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>
        The four pages of content will include: <i>product offering, reviews, camera roll, and used grails.</i> Firstly
        we have
        the product offering page which will be our main shop wherre we list the products that our brand offers.
        Although we currently have no products, the inferface of this page will display photos of products that have
        similar designs and styles to our concepts. The reviews page will be a blog-style page which will feature our
        favorite brands and their products as well as an in depth review. The camera roll page will consist of photos
        and videos, both from ourselves and third party users, to showcase the lifestyle that we resonate with as well
        as provide resources such as travel destinations, cool stores to visit, best restaurants in town, and much more.
        Finally, we have the used grails page which is a second hand market type page where we resell any used clothing
        that we can obtain that fits embodies our brand image.
